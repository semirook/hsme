# HSME [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/semirook/hsme.png)](https://travis-ci.org/semirook/hsme)

Another Python Finite State Machine implementation. Neat API, simple declaration, tested, documented.

## What?

First of all you have to be familiar with [finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) 
(FSM) model. If you have no idea what is it for and why it can be really helpful in your project, please,
spend some time to read a bit of theory to take that "aha!" moment.

You can jump to the examples to see some cases, solutions and general idea.

## Installation

As usual, with pip:

```bash
$ pip install hsme
```
